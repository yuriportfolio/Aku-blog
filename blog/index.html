<li>Freedom is a universal human right. What does it mean to you? What does it mean to us? To Ukraine? To the world? This digital illustration depicts the struggle of Ukrainian people for their freedom and independence.</li>
<li>War is a painful reality that many people face. This digital illustration depicts the story of Ukrainian struggle for freedom and independence. It is an expression of the feelings that many Ukrainians and people around the world felt about Russia's invasion.</li>
<li>War is not a game. It's not something to be taken lightly, or something to be glorified. It's a serious matter that affects the lives of so many people. This artwork is meant to remind people of the horrors of war and the devastation it can bring. This artwork is a call for peace!</li>
<li>In the struggle for values, truth is born. Art is a powerful medium that can be used to express truth and share it with others. Whether you're an artist or not, we want to help you find your truth through art.</li>
<li>This digital art is a reminder that freedom is worth fighting for and that we must fight for it. We will never forget what it's like to be free.</li>
<li>With the rise of new tyrannical regimes and a general increase in global authoritarianism, it is more important than ever to remember that our desire for freedom is what will ultimately save us.</li>
<li>Freedom is what makes humans unique. It's the desire to be free that inspires revolutions and protest movements. It's what enables humans to rise and take control of their destiny.</li>
<li>Freedom is worth fighting for, and dying for, and living for.The desire to be free is the most important thing in the world. You can take our lives, but you'll never take away the desire to be free.</li>
<li>We are not the only ones who refuse to surrender. We are not the only ones who will never give up. We are not the only ones who refuse to be silenced.</li>
<li>We will stand up for what we believe in. We will speak out when we see injustice. We will be brave enough to take a stand and say, “I am not afraid of you”. We refuse to be silenced by fear, or oppression, or violence, or hate.</li>
<li>No matter how many battles we win, or how many lives we take, the desire to be free will never die. It's in our blood.</li>
<li>The idea of freedom is what binds us together as a nation. And it's part of who we are as people. We're not born with the desire for freedom - it's something that has to be fought for and protected every day. ⁣⁣</li>
<li>“The desire to be free is one of the deepest and most powerful yearnings of the human soul.”- Nelson Mandela. The will to be free is stronger than any bullet.</li>
<li>We believe that good always wins. And we’re here to make sure of it. It’s time to take a stand for what's right.</li>
<li>Life is full of ups and downs and it's easy to feel like you are fighting a losing battle. It's important not to give up, because ultimately good will prevail.</li>
<li>A warrior of light is someone who fights for his freedom and the future. He is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, even if it means fighting for it. He never gives up, and always stands strong against adversity.</li>
<li>We are not here to be the victims, but the victors. We are not here to be defeated, but to be victorious.</li>
<li>“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”- Eleanor Roosevelt. Stand up for what you believe in, fight for what you love, and be the voice of the voiceless.</li>
<li>This illustration is haunting and beautiful and it explores the depths of human emotion, from sorrow to rage to hope.</li>

          </h1>
          <span class="post-date">October 14, 2020</span>
          <h2 id="does-high-quality-mean-high-price">Does high-quality mean high price?</h2>
<p>The high price is a fee for quality, professional team, and the vast range of services provided.</p>
<p>One might get the impression that a high-quality cleaning with a professional team might be expensive, but this is not the case. It is a common misconception that high quality means high price. Quality can be achieved at any price point, and the commercial cleaning industry is a perfect example of this.</p>
<p>The high-quality commercial cleaning company is not just about hiring a professional team of cleaners. It's also about investing in the right equipment and software for your business. This will help you get better results with less time, effort and money spent on training your team and maintaining them.</p>
<p>SHEN has found a way to offer a high-level service without sacrificing price. We came to an understanding that cleaning software can offer a lower cost solution without compromising on quality. This has been made possible by the use of algorithms that can efficiently map and plan routes for cleaners to follow, eliminating the need for human intervention in certain tasks.</p>
<p>We analyze each service in detail and check its quality at each stage. This gives us an opportunity to control quality according to many criteria - completion, schedules, checklists, photos. There is a connection with our manager, who picks up any issue at any stage. We reduce the negative impact of the human factor because our program has a module for employee protection. Additionally, we have worked out all cleaning regulations, algorithms, and norms in each area in order to predict risks so that they have less of an impact on service quality.</p>
<p>This is how you can get your workspace cleaned with a team of professionals for less than you would think and without compromising on quality.</p>
<p>This is what makes SHEN the best commercial cleaning company in the area.</p>
<p>Clean for the best price. Call us.</p>

          </h1>
          <span class="post-date">August 29, 2019</span>
          <p>Akulina: Italy is famous not only for its picturesque landscapes, delicious pasta and amazing wine. Many talented music producers are born there, so, it seems, Italian electronic scene is well developed. Being involved in techno movement from 90s, you may observe how Italian techno scene was formed and evolved. Has it changed greatly since that time? How would you describe current situation?</p>
<p>F﻿abrizio: The question is very complex and touches many aspects, not only musical but also social and economic. Surely the techno scene has changed a lot in our country as in the rest of the world. Talking just about music I could briefly say that everything was born in Rome between 1989 and 1991 thanks to a few artists, real pioneers, who characterized the sound of Rome and the first raves. It was something revolutionary, pure and spontaneous, that I lived only from the outside (thanks to some local radio stations, very popular at the time, and thanks to re-mix, dj record shop real fulcrum of the system) because I was just 15 or 16 years old. Today in our country these characteristics are gone, although there are still many excellent artists. Today, marketing has much more value than in the past.</p>
<p>Akulina: What does “underground” means to you?</p>
<p>F﻿abrizio: For me, undergound means pure, out of mainstream logics.</p>
<p>Akulina: How did you come on a decision to produce music?</p>
<p>F﻿abrizio: After many years as local dj I needed to do something more to express myself and my techno view and in 2008 I founded Attic Music and started producing.</p>
<p>Akulina: Tell us about Attic Music. What is the philosophy of label and your personal definition of techno? How do you select artists?</p>
<p>F﻿abrizio: There isn’t a philosophy or a concept. I just produce what I like and what I would play: tripping dark techno from deeper to banger, but also ambient and something different as for example the acid sound of Boston 168. </p>
<p>Akulina: Your last and yet a debut album “Intraverso” shows down-tempo, ambient influences and is beyond your usual style. Why did you choose this direction? Is there a story behind it?</p>
<p>F﻿abrizio: When I decided to work on my debut album I had no good times for private reasons so It was natural for me to express this side of my music.</p>
<p>Akulina: Do you believe in destiny and what is your biggest dream?</p>
<p>F﻿abrizio: I only believe in human strength and will. My dream is to do a radio show.</p>

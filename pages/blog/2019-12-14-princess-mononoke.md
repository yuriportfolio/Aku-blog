\*﻿The task was to write up to ten generalized predictions based on different card combinations, with a short, effective lead for the NFT project. Here are several examples based on the Tarot card meaning.

### Do you believe in the power of Tarot cards?

The Tarot cards are a symbol of the past, present, and future. They have been used as tools of divination and guidance for centuries. “The Eternal Journey” is a kit of design Tarot cards that goes together with a personal prediction. It's an easy way to get started in the world of tarot and it's a great gift for someone who is interested in this spiritual practice.

Let your future unfold before your eyes.

Prediction for - The Lovers, The Emperor, The Chariot.

* The Lovers is about the connection between two people. The Emperor is about authority, control, and power. The Chariot is about being in charge of one's life journey. What does this mean for you? It means that it's time to take control of your life and stop waiting for others to make things happen for you. It's time to be a leader and not a follower. Live your life on your terms and be the best version of yourself!

Prediction for - The Tower, Wheel of Fortune, Temperance.

* Skyrocketing success is yours to enjoy, if you dare and grab the moment! You’ve reached a turning point. Wheel of Fortune has blessed you with a new opportunity. See trees changing colours as they prepare for winter? That’s how your life feels right now. You need to trust the Universe and seize the day! The Tower is the doorway to opportunity and dynamism, but can also make or break our stability and direction. Temperance is there to unify conflicting energies, and heal ailments of previous cycles.
